# UE4 Save Files
## Resources
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/SaveGame/index.html)
- [UE4 AnswerHub](https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/136977/where-are-the-save-slots-in-packaged-projects-on-w.html)

## Notes
- In packaged build, save files are located in
```
C:\Users\{UserName}\AppData\Local\XD\Saved\SaveGames
```

## Experiences
- I thought it is located in `[Game Root Folder]/Saved/SavedGames` and apparently deleting those files do not reset the local data
